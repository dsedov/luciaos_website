Given that you're a solo developer building a full-stack OS inspired by the Thousand Brains Theory, starting "in the middle" is a smart intuition. That sweet spot lets you:

- Prototype core architectural ideas quickly
- Stay hardware-agnostic (initially)
- Influence both UI/UX design *and* kernel needs as you go

Here’s a concrete roadmap that balances vision, feasibility, and architectural alignment:

---

### 🧠 **1. Start with the Cortical Column Abstraction (Middle Layer)**
This is the foundation of your system’s intelligence and identity.

**Build a “Learning Module” prototype:**
- **Input:** A stream of features + relative location info (vision, audio, or text)
- **Core:** Sparse Distributed Representation (SDR) system, reference frame handling, voting logic
- **Output:** Object hypotheses or predictions
- **Storage:** Persistent associative memory (SDR-to-object mapping, possibly using a vector DB or sparse vector store)

✅ *Goal:* Get 1–2 modules (e.g. vision + text) learning and voting on simple synthetic data like "toy objects", or text snippets.

---

### ⚙️ **2. Design the Internal Messaging Bus / “Cortical Messaging Protocol”**
Once you have 2–3 modules, you need a way for them to talk and vote.

- Build a message-passing layer (start with in-memory pub/sub or agent model)
- Define a message schema: object ID proposals, sensory predictions, pose updates, feedback
- Later, this becomes your "cortex bus" (think of it like an OS-level IPC but brain-style)

✅ *Goal:* Support consensus inference across multiple sensory streams

---

### 💻 **3. Build a Userland Demo App (UI-Level Shell)**
This gives you a visible feedback loop early and will guide what abstractions you need later.

- Simple sandbox app: the user gives inputs (image, phrase, etc.)
- Shows how the system processes them using columns + voting
- Can simulate user interaction as a conversation or command prompt

✅ *Goal:* Demonstrate concept of "object-based cognition" replacing files/apps

---

### 🧩 **4. Layer in a Mini Runtime (“Soft Kernel”)**
Once you see how modules work and talk, start thinking downward:

- What tasks need scheduling? Resource isolation?
- What’s your equivalent of “process” and “thread”?
- Will modules be long-lived processes or event-driven services?

You could implement a soft runtime first (like Erlang/Elixir’s BEAM) before touching metal.

✅ *Goal:* Map out a minimal “task fabric” for running learning modules and sensors

---

### 🧠✨ **5. Explore Modalities One by One**
Instead of tackling multimodal all at once, go vertical first. Pick:

- **Vision (Synthetic first)**: e.g. MNIST-style symbols scanned through narrow field
- **Text:** A parser that takes sequences and encodes SDRs from word-location
- **Touch (Simulated mouse movements over image):** fake pose data

✅ *Goal:* Create single-sense columns that later coordinate

---

### 🪛 **6. Kernel & Hardware Later (Low Layer)**
When abstractions are stable, start shaping the low-level system:

- Build a minimalist kernel (start with something like [Xv6](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2021/xv6.html) or a Rust-based one like [Theseus](https://www.theseus-os.com/))
- Consider real-time needs, message routing, sensor polling, and modular hotplug support
- Aim for an OS that boots into your column environment — not a traditional shell

✅ *Goal:* Replace Unix-style process/filesystem abstractions with cortical modules & SDR storage

---

### 🌱 Recommendations for Early Stack

- **Language:** Rust (safety + systems-level control + async + growing AI libs)
- **Runtime:** Tokio or Actix for async message-driven system
- **Storage:** Redis or LMDB for prototype SDR storage; later a custom persistent SDR store
- **Vision/Text:** Use NumPy + PyTorch or even OpenCV + Transformers for early bootstrapping, but abstract them as “sensors”

---

### ⚗️ Bonus: Early Experimental Ideas
- Use touch + vision in a simulated 2D world to let columns learn object models
- Record every interaction and start bootstrapping the system’s semantic memory
