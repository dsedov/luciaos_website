# Return Infinity

- [Return Infinity - BareMetal](https://www.returninfinity.com/baremetal.html) - BareMetal is our very lean kernel. The name is a play on the phrase "bare metal" which means to run directly on physical or virtualized hardware. BareMetal also only offers the "bare essentials" required for a working operating system.
BareMetal provides basic support for symmetric multiprocessing, network, and drive access via a low-level abstraction layer.
All source code is available [here](https://github.com/ReturnInfinity/BareMetal).
