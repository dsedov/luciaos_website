# The Building Blocks

LUCIA OS has many levels at which we can look and understand the underlying architecture. Frameworks allow us to thinkg of individual systems, like kernel, drivers, ui, memory management and so on. Modules are building blocks of each framework, program and so on. Human /AI Scale describes how much of a module is built by human and how much of it has been build by an AI system.
