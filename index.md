LUCIA OS represents my commitment to reimagining computing from first principles, prioritizing humans without being constrained by legacy conventions.

You're in a world without files, folders, or organizational systems. Unsettling, isn't it? This discomfort stems from what you've been conditioned to accept as norm.

Standing on the shoulders of giants, we've inherited a comfortable yet compromised computing paradigm. We've accepted certain patterns simply because they were presented as the standard. Computers, designed to make difficult tasks manageable, made us willing to adapt our behavior to reap the benefits.

The balance between user experience and system requirements always favored the machines. Computing began with 1s and 0s, progressed to Assembly language, upward through increasingly abstract layers: kernels, drivers, operating systems, graphical user interfaces, input devices, periphery, form factors... We've built layers upon layers, shifting and adding complexity in a race for the latest competitive technology. We didn't allow for time to stop and think or reavaluate how we design these systems. 

The design by commettee approach tried to make everyone happy -- made no one happy. The "don't offend the user" produced in unmanagable bloat.

## How?

We find ourselves in a digital ecosystem with few viable alternatives. Challenging the status quo is difficult when every component of a system has been engineered for self-preservation. The memetic DNA actively resists change.

Yet there's hope in this realization. Just as our current computing environment was built incrementally, we can engineer a better experience step by step, founded on new values and principles. The shortcomings of today's systems create space for innovation.

Start small -- make big impact.

Modern harware is billions times faster than what was available 30 years ago, yet it's not billion times more useful. The faster the hardware grew the more convoluted software became.

What do we want from a modern computer? What will covers most of our needs? What has to run locally and what can be offsourced to a more efficiently designed provider? By answering those questions we can work backward and describe an ideal system at an interaction level, at a software level, at an OS level and finally at a hardware level.
