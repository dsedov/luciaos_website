Perfect place to start. Understanding the separation between **sensory modules** and **learning modules** is core to how the Thousand Brains Theory plays out in Monty‚Äîand what makes this architecture fundamentally different from classical pipelines in AI.

Let‚Äôs break it down and connect it to what‚Äôs happening in the code you linked from Numenta‚Äôs Monty project.

## üß† Key Concept: Sensory Module ‚Üî Learning Module

### üåê 1. **What is a Sensory Module?**

In the Monty/Thousand Brains model, a **sensory module** represents a *sensor with a narrow field of view*. It captures:

- A **feature** (what was sensed)
- A **location** (where it was sensed on the object)
- A **sensor pose** (where the sensor itself is, relative to the object)
- A **movement signal** (how the sensor moved to get here)

It‚Äôs responsible for converting raw data (pixels, audio, characters‚Ä¶) into **sparse, semantically-meaningful features tied to locations**.

üîë It is **not** just a preprocessor. It's actively involved in learning a *reference frame* for the object, using the assumption:  
> "To recognize a structure, I must know both *what* I sensed and *where* I sensed it."

### üß† 2. **What is a Learning Module (Column)?**

A learning module is like a **cortical column**.

It receives:
- Encoded **feature** and **location** data from one or more sensory modules
- It *accumulates evidence* over time (from multiple sensor movements)
- It tries to match what it's sensing now against previously learned **object models**
- It builds and stores its own internal model of an object (as a set of features in locations)

It can then:
- Predict what it expects to see next
- Vote for the likely object
- Learn new objects from scratch if nothing matches

---

### üîÑ 3. **How They Work Together (Flow)**

Here‚Äôs a simplified data flow:

```
Raw Sensor Input (e.g. RGB patch, audio frame, word)
       ‚Üì
[Sensory Module]
       - Extracts features (edges, frequencies, embeddings)
       - Gets pose info from the motor system
       - Encodes (feature, location) pair in a sparse form (SDR or hash)
       ‚Üì
[Learning Module]
       - Uses (feature, location) to activate internal object representations
       - Updates beliefs about which object is being sensed
       - Outputs: predictions, object ID, feedback
```

## üîç What the Monty Code is Doing (High-Level)

In `abstract_monty_classes.py`, you‚Äôll find the abstract base classes that define the **interface** and **structure** for both types of modules. Let‚Äôs look at the key ones:

### `SensorModel` (abstract)
```python
class SensorModel(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def observe(self, env: SensorEnvironment) -> SensorReading:
        ...
```
- This is the base class for *any* sensor: touch, vision, language, etc.
- `observe()` returns a `SensorReading`, which contains:
  - A **feature vector** (e.g., ‚Äúred edge‚Äù or ‚Äútoken: cat‚Äù)
  - The **location** on the object where this feature was observed
  - Optional **movement metadata** (so the system knows how you got there)

### `LearningModule` (abstract)
```python
class LearningModule(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def learn(self, observation: SensorReading):
        ...
```
- This is a cortical-column-like module.
- It takes the `SensorReading` from the sensor model and tries to **map it to an object** it‚Äôs already learning or has learned before.
- Over time, it builds up an internal representation of the object.

## üî¨ Sensor Encoding in Practice

You asked **how exactly the sensory module encodes raw data** into a form the learning module understands. This is the trickiest but most important part. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs usually involved:

### 1. **Feature Extraction**
Depending on modality:
- **Vision**: edge detection, color blob, object parts
- **Text**: word/token embedding (e.g. word2vec/GPT token)
- **Audio**: MFCC or frequency band activation

These are typically preprocessed or downsampled heavily. We're not giving the whole image or sound‚Äîjust a "fovea".

### 2. **Pose and Location Encoding**
This is critical: every feature has to be associated with a *relative location* on the object.

- That might be a 2D coordinate (`x, y`)
- Or a symbolic location (e.g., ‚Äústart of sentence‚Äù)
- In Monty, this is passed via the `SensorPose` object

Numenta uses grid-cell-like mechanisms to encode location. In simplified versions, you can just treat it as a tuple or index.

### 3. **Sparse Encoding**
After combining the **feature + location**, the sensor module **encodes** this into a **sparse, high-dimensional vector**.

Think of it like:
```python
sdr = hash(feature + location) ‚Üí sparse bits set in a 2048-bit vector
```

This SDR is the common "language" passed to the learning module.

## üß† Where to Start Hands-On

To play with this conceptually:

### A. **Simulate a Sensor in Python**
```python
def simulate_sensor():
    fovea = get_patch_from_image(x, y)
    feature = extract_feature(fovea)      # e.g., "vertical edge"
    location = (x, y)
    return encode(feature, location)
```

### B. **Build a Basic Column**
```python
def learn_from_observation(sdr):
    if match_existing_object(sdr):
        update_belief(object_id)
    else:
        start_new_object_model(sdr)
```

### C. **Watch Voting Work**
Give two columns (e.g., text and image) overlapping signals and have them converge on one object ID.

## üß≠ Next Step Options

1. **Want to try writing a toy version of this in code?** We can write a super minimal sensory module + learning module prototype together.
2. **Want help digging deeper into Monty's actual implementations?** I can walk you through their real classes and methods from source.
3. **Or prefer to design your own simplified variant first?** We can sketch your own take on this without the constraints of Numenta‚Äôs API.
