## Intro

This document translates the vision of Lucia OS into a stage‑by‑stage list of user‑facing experience milestones and the backend capabilities that enable them. It shows how the two decoupled tracks of UX and Cognitive Technology Stack evolve from the first prototype to the fully realised cognitive operating system.

LUCIA OS advances along two parallel, loosely coupled rails:

* UX (frontend) - the human‑facing surface that grows in fluency and initiative.
* Cognitive Technology Stack (backend) – the substrate that implements those abilities, evolving from today’s LLM foundations toward brain‑inspired kernels.

The separation lets us ship useful features early while re‑architecting the core in the background.

---

## Stage 0 - Prototype

Establish MVP. Provide early scaffolding for future market fit search, and experementation with UX.

### UX
Conversational shell owns a Telegram username and an email for communication. 
Proactive alerts: "You have new mail from ... with a summary" 
On question‑bearing e‑mails, LUCIA surfaces the questions to the user, captures answers, and auto‑sends a reply to the original sender. Telegram username can proactivly act as an assistant.

### Backend

LLM based with several system propts based on the place in interaction pipeline. 
* Owner -> Assistant
* External -> Assistant

Storage:
* List of persistant facts
* List of short-term facts
* Conversation context
* Problem / Question queue to resolve with owner / external

### Hardware
Minimal hardware requirements. Most of this is hosted on a tiny shared VPS. LLM capability provided by one of the frotier labs: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google etc.

## Stage 0.5 - Extended prototype

This stage is focusted on UX and fixing what we've learned while establishing a backend.

### UX
* Work on timing of messages
* Work on classification of messaging. What is important? What is relevant? What is urgent? What is part of long-term persistant memory, short-term memory, immidiate context?

### Backend
* Try multiple models
* Try multipl VPS providers
* Do cost/capability analysis. 
* Make a model to predict scaling / growth problems
* Maybe explore local models?

## Stage 1 · Context‑Aware Assistant

### UX
Persistent memory—remembers preferences and past conversations
Browsing & downloads are auto‑embedded into the local knowledge graph; user asks "What did I read about HTM yesterday?"
Multi‑channel notifications (desktop, mobile, wearables) |

### Backend
Local vector store w/ incremental embedding
Retrieval‑augmented answering (RAG) over personal corpus
Event bus ingesting web pages, files, IoT signals; lightweight privacy sandbox                                                               

---

## Stage 2 · Multimodal Companion
### UX
Vision & audio understanding: screenshots, camera, mic
Contextual UI overlays—suggest actions in‑flow ("Clip this chart?"), no apps
Timeline views of integrated memory across modalities                            |

### Backend
Sensing kernels (vision, audio, touch)
On‑device GPUs / NPUs for local inference
Sparse HTM‑inspired learning kernels for continuous adaptation
Motor kernels begin guiding attention & orchestrating tasks 

---

## Stage 3 · Cognitive Partner

### UX

Real‑time collaboration: anticipates needs, offers plans, runs multi‑step workflows autonomously
Embodied across devices; seamless hand‑off
Rich mixed‑reality expressions (gesture, spatial audio) 
First implementation of apps as learned skill

### Backend
Predictive hierarchical mesh of kernels across modalities
World model with temporal pooling & sensor‑motor loops
Low‑power neuromorphic co‑processors
Federated learning for privacy‑preserving personalisation |

---

## Stage 4 · Ultimate Cognitive OS

### UX
Symbiotic companion—understands life narrative, goals, emotions
Generates and executes long‑horizon plans; negotiates with external agents
Zero‑interface ambient mode; system intervenes only when valuable
Learn from user. Learn from external sources. App store of skills?

### Backend
Distributed kernel swarm—runs on heterogeneous edge devices
Self‑optimising resource allocation; energy proportional
Secure enclave for personal memory; cryptographic provenance of actions
Social graph of kernel‑to‑kernel communication for group cognition
