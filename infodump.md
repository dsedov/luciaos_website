### Direct Answer

Your idea for an OS where the file system is not exposed, and users interact entirely through natural language—such as asking to "open the book I was writing yesterday about 'blah blah'"—is fascinating and aligns with current AI trends. However, based on available information, it seems likely that no such OS is currently on the market or widely known.

**Current Landscape**  
There are systems like Siri ([Natural-language user interface - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_user_interface)) and Alexa that allow natural language interaction, but these are assistants built on top of existing OSes like iOS or Android, not replacements. They still rely on traditional file systems and apps. For example, Braina is a natural language interface for Windows, but it's an add-on, not a new OS ([Natural-language user interface - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_user_interface)).

**Research and Startups**  
Research from the 1990s, like the THJ interface for Unix and MS-DOS ([General natural language for operating systems | ACM SIGART Bulletin](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/141420.141425)), explored natural language for OSes, but these were experimental and outdated. Modern NLP startups, such as Cohere and Aleph Alpha ([Top 111 Natural Language Processing startups (December 2024)](https://www.ai-startups.org/top/natural_language_processing/)), focus on APIs and applications, not full OSes. No known startup has developed an OS matching your description as of March 17, 2025.

**Future Potential**  
Your concept, where documents can be programs and communication flows freely without apps, is innovative and could be feasible with advancements in large language models (LLMs). It’s an unexpected detail that while no such OS exists yet, the technology is heading in this direction, with AI agents potentially evolving to manage tasks in a similar way.

In summary, while your idea is promising and aligns with AI research, there’s no evidence of a matching OS currently available. It might be worth exploring as a future project, given the rapid progress in NLP.

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Natural Language Operating Systems

This note provides a comprehensive analysis of the user's query regarding the existence of an operating system (OS) where the file system is not exposed, all interactions are through natural language, documents can function as programs, and communication flows freely without traditional apps. The investigation covers current systems, historical research, startup landscapes, and future possibilities, ensuring a thorough understanding for both technical and non-technical audiences.

#### Background and User Concept
The user's idea envisions a revolutionary OS that hides the traditional file system, allowing users to interact via natural language commands, such as "open the book I was writing yesterday about 'blah blah.'" This OS would leverage large language models (LLMs) to enable documents to function as programs, breaking free from the constraints of spreadsheets and specialized software. Communication and information retrieval would be seamless, with no need for specific apps, enabling a fluid flow of information like asking the OS to "show images" or "find something online."

This concept is ambitious, combining natural language processing (NLP), AI, and a complete rethinking of OS paradigms, potentially transforming how users interact with computers to mimic human-like communication.

#### Current Systems and Natural Language Interfaces
A search for existing systems revealed that while there are natural language interfaces (NLIs) for OSes, none fully replace the traditional file system with the user's described model. For instance:
- **Braina** is noted as a natural language interface for Windows OS, allowing users to type or speak English sentences to perform actions or find information ([Natural-language user interface - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_user_interface)). However, it is an add-on, not a replacement OS, and still relies on the underlying file system.
- **Voice Assistants**: Systems like Siri (integrated with iOS), Alexa, and Google Assistant enable natural language interaction for tasks like setting reminders or searching the web. These are assistants built on top of existing OSes, not standalone OSes, and they depend on app ecosystems ([What Is NLP (Natural Language Processing)? | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/natural-language-processing)).
- **DuerOS**: Baidu's DuerOS is a conversational AI platform for smart devices, with over 400 million installations by 2019, supporting voice queries ([Baidu’s DuerOS voice platform is now on 400 million devices | VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/ai/baidus-dueros-voice-platform-is-now-on-400-million-devices/)). However, it is not an OS but a layer for devices like smart speakers and refrigerators, not a general-purpose computing OS.

These systems demonstrate that natural language interaction is possible, but they are not the full OS replacement the user envisions, as they still operate within traditional OS frameworks.

#### Historical Research and Experimental Systems
Historical research provides insight into early attempts at natural language OS interfaces:
- A 1990 paper titled "General natural language for operating systems" from ACM SIGART Bulletin proposed a natural language interface using an Application-Independent Hierarchic approach (AIH), developing an experimental interface called THJ for Unix, VMS, and MS-DOS ([General natural language for operating systems | ACM SIGART Bulletin](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/141420.141425)). This was a significant effort, but it was experimental, outdated, and not a full OS without a file system.
- Other early NLP research, such as ELIZA (1965) and Lunar (1970s), focused on specific tasks like psychotherapy simulation or database queries, not general-purpose OSes ([Natural language processing - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing)).

These efforts show that the concept has been explored, but no widely adopted system emerged from these early experiments, likely due to technological limitations at the time.

#### Startup Landscape and NLP Focus
The startup ecosystem was extensively searched for companies developing NLP-based OSes:
- Lists of NLP startups, such as those from Failory ([Top 42 Natural Language Processing Startups in 2024](https://www.failory.com/startups/natural-language-processing)) and AI Startups ([Top 111 Natural Language Processing startups (December 2024)](https://www.ai-startups.org/top/natural_language_processing/)), highlight companies like Cohere, Fractal, and Aleph Alpha. These focus on APIs, platforms, and specific applications (e.g., customer service bots, data analysis), not on creating new OSes.
- For example, Cohere offers an API for language processing, and Gong.io uses NLP for sales training, but neither is developing a fileless, natural language OS ([Top 111 Natural Language Processing startups (December 2024)](https://www.ai-startups.org/top/natural_language_processing/)).
- No startup was found explicitly working on an OS where the file system is hidden, and all interactions are natural language-based, with documents as programs.

This suggests that while NLP is a hot area for startups, the focus is on enhancing existing systems, not replacing them with a new OS paradigm.

#### Conceptual and Future Possibilities
The user's idea aligns with conceptual discussions in AI research:
- **Natural Language Programming (NLP)**: This is distinct from the user's idea, focusing on writing programs in natural language, not an OS ([Natural-language programming - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_programming)). However, it shows the potential for LLMs to generate code from prompts, which could support the "documents as programs" aspect.
- **AI Agents and Ambient Intelligence**: Research into AI agents and ambient intelligence (AmI) systems suggests systems that can understand and act on natural language without explicit commands, potentially evolving into OS-like systems ([Natural Language Processing Systems - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/natural-language-processing-systems)). However, these are not currently full OSes.
- **Future Trends**: With LLMs advancing, it's conceivable that such an OS could be developed, where the OS manages data and tasks internally, presenting a natural language interface. This could be particularly relevant for future computing paradigms, such as AI-driven personal assistants managing all user interactions.

An unexpected detail is that while no such OS exists, the technology is heading in this direction, with AI agents potentially evolving to manage tasks in a similar way, blurring the line between OS and AI interface.

#### Challenges and Considerations
Implementing such an OS would face challenges:
- **Technical Feasibility**: Hiding the file system and managing all data via natural language would require advanced NLP to handle ambiguity and context, potentially leading to errors in understanding user intent.
- **User Adoption**: Users accustomed to file systems might find a purely natural language interface limiting for complex tasks, as noted in discussions about NLIs ([A Natural Language User Interface is just a User Interface | Medium](https://medium.com/swlh/a-natural-language-user-interface-is-just-a-user-interface-4a6d898e9721)).
- **Performance**: Real-time processing of natural language for all OS functions could be resource-intensive, especially with LLMs requiring significant computational power ([What Is Natural Language Processing? | Supermicro](https://www.supermicro.com/en/glossary/nlp)).

Despite these challenges, the idea is innovative and could be a future direction, especially as AI and NLP continue to evolve.

#### Comparative Table: Existing Systems vs. User Concept

|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| File System Exposure    | Exposed, users can access files and folders   | Hidden, no file system interaction  |
| Interaction Method      | Natural language for specific tasks, via apps | Entirely natural language, no apps  |
| Documents as Programs   | No, documents are static, programs separate   | Yes, documents can be programs via LLMs |
| Communication Flow      | App-based, e.g., messaging apps for communication | Seamless, OS relays information directly |
| Current Availability    | Widely available as add-ons                   | Not known to exist as of March 17, 2025 |

This table highlights the gap between current systems and the user's vision, reinforcing that no matching OS is currently known.

#### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, there is no publicly known startup, product, or research project that has developed an OS matching the user's description as of March 17, 2025. While natural language interfaces and assistants exist, they are add-ons to traditional OSes, not replacements. Historical research, like the THJ interface, was experimental and outdated, and modern NLP startups focus on applications, not OS development. However, the concept is innovative and aligns with AI and NLP trends, suggesting potential for future development.

For users interested in pursuing this idea, it could be a promising area for research or startup ventures, given the rapid advancements in LLMs and AI agents.
